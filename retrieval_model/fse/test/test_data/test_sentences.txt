Good stuff i just wish it lasted longer 
Hp makes qualilty stuff

El producto es excelente me encanto , recomiendo al vendedor y el producto ampliamente , se cumplio con el tiempo estimado de envio
Unfortunatly my first was the wrong battery 
The second order did the job and was received within 5 days and working as good as ever 
I did not get a return label to send the first battery back 
Could you please send one to me so i can get the credit back on my credit card 
Thank you for your help 
I bought the 32 gig touch for my 12 year old granddaughter and she loves it , especially the video camera feature 
It is amazing to me how adept the young people are in using this great tool 
She had a older itouch which is now being used by her 6 year old sister 
They both love the vast array of apps that are available from apple 
I recommend this as a great gift 
Apple products are amazing 
Mine just came in the mail today and i am about to set it up 
I went to lg 
Com and they have it for sale there for the msrp of $ 79 
Save yourself money and buy it direct from lg 
I feel like i just got screwed 
As advised by many reviews , i bought a size bigger and that is really a good piece of advice because the belt fits just right at the middle hole 
I must admit i had little hope for these cheap little buds 
But after popping them in for a test drive , i must admit that they are so comfy 
I keep forgetting they are in and have to keep checking 
The sound quality is pretty amazing for such a cheap pair of buds , clear , loud , not like some of the $ 20 - $ 30 ear buds i have tried that sound muffled and quiet , and i end up pitching 
I do not normally leave reviews on amazon , but these are great little buds that deserve a try 
I have just bought 5 more pairs , some as gifts , but mostly for me to hoard , as i will no doubt loose / break this pair eventually 
The only thing i can not say , is how they stay in with movement , i mainly use earbuds when i am working on a computer or when walking the dogs for a few hours 
So we will see how they hold up 
I have to say i was very disappointed with this trimmer after using it for the first time 
I bought it to replace the nose / ear trimming portion of my all - in - one groomer that finally gave out after 7 years 
The instructions for cleaning the trimmer are more confusing than they need to be and the actual cleaning is tedious 
I was more than a little miffed that using the device on my nose often resulted in quick little tugs as the blade yanked a hair out rather than cutting it 
And after all that , i had to go back and use it again right away because it left huge conspicuous hairs untouched after the first use 
All in all it took about 5 minutes , whereas i would expect such a procedure to take maybe 30 - 45 seconds 
The blade this replaced was one of 5 uses for a similarly cheap groomer , and it worked infinitely better 
I am going to have to look and see if they still make that model and replace this junker 
I was really skeptical at first , but the phone was even better than i expected 
I absolutely love it 
I had no issues with it whatsoever and will continue doing business with them 
Really awesome 
I love the color , the ease of usage , hte size matterof fact everything about this nano except that i droped it on the ceramic floor and broke the glass 
It still works 
That was a bummer
Looks good and fits snug 
I am happy with it 
I use it at the gym 
I love the shade of green 
I was originally turned onto this via starbucks as an iced tea so now i usually use to make iced tea and was so happy to find it in the k - cups 
A basic phone which does what it is suppose to do , the thing i like most is the distinctive ring 
Easy to set up and use
I really like this phone 
It is easy to use , and minimal directions 
There is alot of bells and whistles , but nothing that can not be programmed in a few seconds
I have not had the experience others have had on this 
I love this thing 
It is like having a coach with you 
You know when you are done with your run , it is going to show you the efforts of your run 
I live out in the sticks , but it never has had an issue connecting with the satellite and the web site shows me all of the pertinent info on my run for the day 
Best thing i have used to track performance when running 
I have always been a big fan of hp products 
This cartridge works perfectly and gives a nice clear and clean print 
Provides a great cheap alternative to the apple tv or an expensive smart tv 
I was so happy with mine that i have since purchased more as gifts for family members 
Easy to set up 
User interface is intuitive and easy to navigate 
Poised to only get better as google adds new features and supported appsvery happy with purchase and would recommend to others 
I think amazon should take this letter in case people are scammers first , if amazon does not seem to me that are accomplices then , buy a bold 9700 phone to reach venezuela just switch it on and the phone does not work the screen goes blank all , i am very upset seems that mocked me as a customer lost my money and here amazon does nothing or draws attention to the store 
By the way do not buy a new phone repowered it really disrespectful
It does not have the standard rear - facing camera for normal picture taking and videos 
It has a face - time camera only 
This makes it hard to take pictures with the thing 
I broke some keys on my laptop , so rather than spend $ 150 to have it repaired , i bought this instead and my computer is good as new 
I am a novice with computer repairs and this took me about five minutes to replace 
Pretty good for the price 
Separate ink cartridge for color really saves you money 
Very difficult to make this wireless printer work with my laptop 
Just settled for wired use 
Love the phone , good speed , all that 
Only thing i find awkward about is , so that when i try to change the volume from the controls on the left of the phone , i often accidentally press the power button on the right of the phone 
Which is annoying 
I have to then press the power button again and log in to continue what i was doing
The product came within the time suggested 
It works great 
Worth the money i paid for it 
Good buy for sure 
This headset actually works well , but it is so uncomfortable to wear that i do not use it 
I found success with the panasonic kx - tca60 hands - free headset with comfort fit headband and the headset buddy adapter 01 - ph25 - pc35 phone headset to pc adapter 
That combination not only sounds great , but it so comfortable i forget to take it off 
Fast shipping on sharp good ceramic knife set 
Have held sharpness for a while of use and will look for ceramic sharpening options 
I bought this as a gift at christmas 
I have heard nothing but praise for it 
You can steam anything you want onto your tv from your computer 
Makes any tv a smart tv for less than $ 40 
I received the battery as ordered 
Replaced the old battery with the new 
It is not holding a charge as long as the old battery did when it was new 
I am not sure if it is a tracfone problem or the battery
